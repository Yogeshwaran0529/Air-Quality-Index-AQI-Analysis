# 🌫️ Air Quality (AQI) Analysis Using Python & R

This project provides an in-depth analysis of **Air Quality Index (AQI)** trends across multiple Indian cities. Using both **Python (Google Colab)** and **R (RStudio)**, it explores pollution behavior, identifies major contributing pollutants, and visualizes patterns to help understand air quality variations.

## 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution is a major environmental concern, especially in urban areas. This project analyzes AQI data to:

- Study AQI trends across cities  
- Identify key pollutants influencing AQI  
- Compare weekday vs weekend pollution patterns  
- Compute pollution index and categorize AQI buckets  
- Generate visual insights using Python & R

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains fields such as:

- **City, Date**
- **PM2.5, NO, NO2, NOx, CO, SO2, O3**
- **AQI & AQI Bucket**
- **Day, Month, Weekend/Weekday flags**
- **Calculated Pollution Index**

## 🔍 Key Insights

- AQI shows noticeable spikes mid-week across major cities.  
- **NO2 and NOx** emerge as strong drivers of AQI variations.  
- **Weekends generally have slightly lower AQI** compared to weekdays.  
- Cities with dense traffic show higher pollution index scores.  
- PM2.5 correlates strongly with AQI across all top cities.
